# Take Me Hire (MVP)

This is a simple React/Tailwind demo app showing how an **NZ Employer ↔ Job Seeker marketplace** could work.

- Employers can search/filter candidates.
- Job seekers can create a profile.
- Data is persisted locally in **localStorage** for demo purposes.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Notes
- This is a demo-level starter. No backend included — data is saved to localStorage.
- To make it production-ready, connect a backend (Supabase/Postgres), add authentication, file uploads, verification flows, and billing.
